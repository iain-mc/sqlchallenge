# Challenge Overview/Objective
The objective of this challenge is to build a website which can be used to A) demonstrate an SQL injection attack, B) demonstrate SQL injection attack mitigation techniques (for example, toggle on/off parameterised queries). Imagine web app being used as an educational tool.

The site can be developed using whatever technologies you wish. 

In this repository there is an example site which is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. It is very basic and does not include any mitigation techniques. Free free to extend this website or create your own. 

# Additional Goals
Can you extend your site to include demonstrations of other common vulnerabilities:

* XSS (Cross Site Scripting)
* CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery)
* etc.
